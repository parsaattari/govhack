    <h3 class="header3">
      <span style="font-size: 26px; color: red;">What is it:</span> Refugee protection program for those outside of Canada
    </h3>
    <h3 class="header3">
      <span style="font-size: 25px; color: red;">Who does it apply to:</span> Typically the reciepents are refugees who have left their homes, and in many cases they have had to live in refugee camps for many years.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="header3">
      <span style="font-size: 25px; color: red;">How do you get chosen:</span> The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), along with private sponsors, identifies refugees for resettlement. A person cannot apply directly to Canada for resettlement. After they are identified, it takes time to process the cases.
      <br>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Private sponsors across the country also help resettle refugees to Canada. Some do this on an ongoing basis. They have signed sponsorship agreements with the Government of Canada to help support refugees. These groups are known as Sponsorship Agreement Holders. Sponsorship Agreement Holders can sponsor refugees themselves, or work with others in the community to do so.
